Generator_intro = This is the siteswap generator component of Juggling Lab, derived from the\n\
   program J2 v2.3, written by Jack Boyce in Feb 1992.  It finds juggling\n\
   patterns in a generalized form of siteswap notation.  For a full\n\
   description of this notation and the program's operation, consult the accom-\n\
   panying documentation files.  All patterns satisfying the given constraints\n\
   are listed by the program.  Solo asynchronous juggling is the default mode.\n\n\
   Usage:    j2 <number> <max throw> <period> [-options]\n\n\
   where options include:\n  \
    -n             show number of patterns\n  \
    -no            print number only\n  \
    -se            hide starting/ending sequences for excited state patterns\n\n  \
    -x <regex> ..  exclude listed regular expressions\n  \
    -i <regex> ..  must include listed regular expressions\n  \
    -lame          remove '11' sequence in asynch mode\n\n  \
    -g             ground state patterns only\n  \
    -ng            excited state patterns only\n  \
    -f             full listing (including composite patterns)\n  \
    -prime         prime patterns only\n  \
    -rot           show all rotated versions of patterns (e.g., 645 and 564)\n\n  \
    -m <number>    multiplexing with at most <number> simultaneous throws\n  \
    -mf            allow simultaneous nontrivial catches (squeeze patterns)\n  \
    -mc            disallow multiplex clustered throws (e.g., [33])\n  \
    -mt            require at least one multiplexed throw with no holds\n\n  \
    -s             find synchronous siteswaps\n\n  \
    -j <number>    set number of jugglers\n  \
    -cp            show only connected passing patterns\n  \
    -d <number>    passing communication delay (see docs)\n  \
    -l <number>    passing leader person number (for use with -d)\n  \
    -jp            show patterns with all juggler permutations\n\n\
   Examples:\n  \
   j2 5 7 5\n  \
   j2 5 7 5 -x 2 3\n  \
   j2 5 7 18 -prime\n  \
   j2 4 6 6 -s -g\n  \
   j2 5 6 4 -m 2 -g -mt\n  \
   j2 6 4 2 -j 2 -g -jp -m 2 -d 1 -l 1
