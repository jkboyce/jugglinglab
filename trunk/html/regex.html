<h2>Siteswap generator regular expression syntax</h2>

<p>For a comprehensive discussion of regular expression matching, read one of the several good tutorials
available on the web (for example, <a href="http://jmason.org/software/sitescooper/tao_regexps.html">A
Tao of Regular Expressions</a>).</p>

<p>Within Juggling Lab, the standard regular expression metacharacters
<code>[]()|</code> require quoting with a backslash <code>'\'</code> to avoid conflict with the use of these
characters in siteswap notation.</p>

<p>The full regular expression syntax accepted by Juggling Lab is described below.  This documentation is
adapted from the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/regexp/index.html">Jakarta-Regexp</a> documentation.</p>

<h4>Characters</h4>
<pre>
   <i>Char</i>          Matches any identical character

</pre>

<h4>Character Classes</h4>
<pre>
   \[abc\]       Simple character class
   \[a-zA-Z\]    Character class with ranges
   \[^abc\]      Negated character class

</pre>

<h4>Standard POSIX Character Classes</h4>
<pre>
   \[:alnum:\]   Alphanumeric characters
   \[:alpha:\]   Alphabetic characters
   \[:digit:\]   Numeric characters

</pre>

<h4>Predefined Classes</h4>
<pre>
   .             Matches any character other than newline
   \d            Matches a digit character
   \D            Matches a non-digit character

</pre>

<h4>Boundary Matchers</h4>
<pre>
   ^             Matches only at the beginning of a line
   $             Matches only at the end of a line

</pre>

<h4>Greedy Closures</h4>
<pre>
   A*            Matches A 0 or more times (greedy)
   A+            Matches A 1 or more times (greedy)
   A?            Matches A 1 or 0 times (greedy)
   A{n}          Matches A exactly n times (greedy)
   A{n,}         Matches A at least n times (greedy)
   A{n,m}        Matches A at least n but not more than m times (greedy)

</pre>

<h4>Reluctant Closures</h4>
<pre>
   A*?           Matches A 0 or more times (reluctant)
   A+?           Matches A 1 or more times (reluctant)
   A??           Matches A 0 or 1 times (reluctant)

</pre>

<h4>Logical Operators</h4>
<pre>
   AB            Matches A followed by B
   A\|B          Matches either A or B
   \(A\)         Used for subexpression grouping
   \(?:A\)       Used for subexpression clustering (just like grouping but no backrefs)

</pre>

<h4>Backreferences</h4>
<pre>
   \1            Backreference to 1st parenthesized subexpression
   \2            Backreference to 2nd parenthesized subexpression
   \3            Backreference to 3rd parenthesized subexpression
   \4            Backreference to 4th parenthesized subexpression
   \5            Backreference to 5th parenthesized subexpression
   \6            Backreference to 6th parenthesized subexpression
   \7            Backreference to 7th parenthesized subexpression
   \8            Backreference to 8th parenthesized subexpression
   \9            Backreference to 9th parenthesized subexpression
</pre>

<p>You can refer to the contents of a parenthesized expression
within a regular expression itself.  This is called a
'backreference'.  The first backreference in a regular expression is
denoted by \1, the second by \2 and so on.  So the expression:</p>

<pre>
\(\[0-9\]+\)=\1
</pre>

<p>will match any string of the form n=n (like 0=0 or 2=2).</p>

<p>All closure operators (+, *, ?, {m,n}) are greedy by default, meaning
that they match as many elements of the string as possible without
causing the overall match to fail.  If you want a closure to be
reluctant (non-greedy), you can simply follow it with a '?'.  A
reluctant closure will match as few elements of the string as
possible when finding matches.  {m,n} closures don't currently
support reluctancy.</p>
