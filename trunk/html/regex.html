<h2>Regular expressions as siteswap generator filters</h2>

<p>The Juggling Lab <a href="ssgenerator.html#regex">siteswap generator</a> allows regular expressions to be used as
output filters.  This page is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a>; for this read one of the
several good tutorials available on the web.</p>

<p>Juggling Lab uses standard regular expression syntax, with some important differences.</p>

<h4>Difference 1:  Swapped metacharacters and literals</h4>

<p>In standard regular expressions, the characters <code>[]()|</code> act as metacharacters with special
non-literal meaning.  Doing a literal match of one of these characters requires a preceding backslash
<code>'\'</code>, for example the regex <code>\[</code> matches the string <code>[</code>.  In
siteswap notation the characters <code>[]()|</code> have special meaning, so relative to
standard regular expressions we swap the roles of <code>[</code> and <code>\[</code>.  So within Juggling Lab the regex
<code>[</code> is a literal match for <code>[</code>, and <code>\[</code> and <code>\]</code> are used
to define character classes (see below).</p>

<h4>Difference 2:  When regular expression filters are applied</h4>

<p>The "include" patterns are applied once, after a pattern is generated but before it is printed.
Therefore the boundary matchers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> do what one expects, matching to the beginning
or end of the pattern respectively.  For example the include filter <code>4$</code> results in patterns ending
with a <code>4</code> throw, since <code>$</code> matches to the end of the pattern.</p>

<p>By contrast, for efficiency reasons the "exclude" filters are applied as the pattern is being built
up, throw by throw.  So the beginning matcher <code>^</code> always matches the beginning of the pattern, but the end
matcher <code>$</code> can match <em>the end of any throw</em>.  (For this purpose, a "throw" is any set of events
occurring simultaneously, e.g., <code>(4,[2x2])</code> counts as a single throw.)  So an exclude filter of <code>4$</code>
excludes patterns containing <code>4</code> throws anywhere, not just at the end of the pattern.</p>

<h4>Difference 3:  Implied wildcard matching</h4>

<p>If the beginning matcher <code>^</code> is not supplied in a given filter term, then a <code>.*</code> wildcard
match is prepended to it.  For <em>include filters only</em>, the same <code>.*</code> is appended to the pattern if no
ending matcher <code>$</code> is supplied.  This is done for convenience, so that for example an include filter of
<code>4</code> will match a <code>4</code> throw anywhere in the pattern (it is converted to <code>.*4.*</code> before
the regex matching is done).</p>

<p>Note that <code>.*</code> is not automatically added to the end of exclude filters.  Thus for example an exclude filter
<code>33</code> will match two successive <code>3</code> throws anywhere in the pattern, but it <em>will not match</em>
the siteswap throw <code>[33]</code>.  One could exclude the latter with a filter pattern of <code>[33]</code> or
<code>33]</code>.</p>

<h2>Juggling Lab regular expression summary</h2>

<h4>Characters</h4>
<pre>
   <i>Char</i>          Matches any identical character

</pre>

<h4>Character Classes</h4>
<pre>
   \[abc\]       Simple character class
   \[a-zA-Z\]    Character class with ranges
   \[^abc\]      Negated character class

</pre>

<h4>Predefined Classes</h4>
<pre>
   .             Matches any character other than newline
   \d            Matches a digit character
   \D            Matches a non-digit character

</pre>

<h4>Boundary Matchers</h4>
<pre>
   ^             Matches only at the beginning of a pattern
   $             Matches at the end of a pattern, or throw (see note above)

</pre>

<h4>Greedy Closures</h4>
<pre>
   A*            Matches A 0 or more times (greedy)
   A+            Matches A 1 or more times (greedy)
   A?            Matches A 1 or 0 times (greedy)
   A{n}          Matches A exactly n times (greedy)
   A{n,}         Matches A at least n times (greedy)
   A{n,m}        Matches A at least n but not more than m times (greedy)

</pre>

<h4>Reluctant Closures</h4>
<pre>
   A*?           Matches A 0 or more times (reluctant)
   A+?           Matches A 1 or more times (reluctant)
   A??           Matches A 0 or 1 times (reluctant)

</pre>

<h4>Logical Operators</h4>
<pre>
   AB            Matches A followed by B
   A\|B          Matches either A or B
   \(A\)         Used for subexpression grouping
   \(?:A\)       Used for subexpression clustering (just like grouping but no backrefs)

</pre>

<h4>Backreferences</h4>
<pre>
   \1            Backreference to 1st parenthesized subexpression
   \2            Backreference to 2nd parenthesized subexpression
   \3            Backreference to 3rd parenthesized subexpression
   \4            Backreference to 4th parenthesized subexpression
   \5            Backreference to 5th parenthesized subexpression
   \6            Backreference to 6th parenthesized subexpression
   \7            Backreference to 7th parenthesized subexpression
   \8            Backreference to 8th parenthesized subexpression
   \9            Backreference to 9th parenthesized subexpression
</pre>

<p>You can refer to the contents of a parenthesized expression
within a regular expression itself.  This is called a
'backreference'.  The first backreference in a regular expression is
denoted by \1, the second by \2 and so on.  So the expression:</p>

<pre>
\(\[0-9\]+\)=\1
</pre>

<p>will match any string of the form n=n (like 0=0 or 2=2).</p>

<p>All closure operators (+, *, ?, {m,n}) are greedy by default, meaning
that they match as many elements of the string as possible without
causing the overall match to fail.  If you want a closure to be
reluctant (non-greedy), you can simply follow it with a '?'.  A
reluctant closure will match as few elements of the string as
possible when finding matches.  {m,n} closures don't currently
support reluctancy.</p>
