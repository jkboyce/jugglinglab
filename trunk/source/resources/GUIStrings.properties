Generator_intro = This is the siteswap generator component of Juggling Lab, derived from the\n\
   program J2 v2.3, written by Jack Boyce in Feb 1992.  It finds juggling\n\
   patterns in a generalized form of siteswap notation.  For a full\n\
   description of this notation and the program's operation, consult the accom-\n\
   panying documentation files.  All patterns satisfying the given constraints\n\
   are listed by the program.  Solo asynchronous juggling is the default mode.\n\n\
   Usage:    j2 number_of_objects max_throw pattern_period [options]\n\n\
   where options include:\n \
    -s  synchronous mode          -j <number>  set number of jugglers\n \
    -n  show number of patterns   -m <number>  multiplexing with at most the\n \
    -no print number only                given number of simultaneous throws\n \
    -g  ground state patterns     -mf  allow simultaneous catches\n \
    -ng excited state patterns    -mc  disallow multiplex clustered throws\n \
    -f  full listing (including   -mt  true multiplexing patterns\n       \
          composite patterns)     -d <number>  passing communication delay\n \
    -se disable starting/ending   -l <number>  passing leader person number\n \
    -prime  only prime patterns   -x <throw> ..  exclude listed self-throws\n \
    -rot  show all rotated        -i <throw> ..  must include listed self-throws\n       \
          versions of patterns    -lame  remove '11' sequence in asynch mode\n \
    -cp connected patterns only   -jp  show all juggler permutations
